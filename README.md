## Introduction

When creating or managing a GitHub repository, it is often beneficial to have a `.github` directory that contains essential files and settings for various GitHub features. However, not all repositories may have a dedicated `.github` directory in their project structure. That's where this repository comes into play.

The `.github` repository acts as a fallback option, providing a standardized structure and necessary files that can be easily incorporated into repositories that lack their own `.github` directory. It ensures consistency and facilitates the adoption of best practices across multiple projects.

## Features

This repository offers the following features:

- Standardized `.github` structure: It includes the necessary files and directories commonly found in a `.github` directory.
- Essential files: The repository contains commonly used files such as `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE`, etc.
- Easy integration: Developers can easily incorporate the `.github` structure and files into their projects by cloning or copying the relevant files from this repository.
- Customization: Users can modify the files and structure according to their project requirements while still benefiting from the initial template.

## File Structure

The repository follows a standardized structure for the `.github` directory:
